      For example, say your developers have come up with the perfect
      amortization program and you want to install it on the workgroup server
      for other systems to remotely mount and use. Because this is a third-party
      or custom application, the logical place for it is in
      <code>/usr/local/appname</code>, possibly with a link to the program
      binary in the <code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory (because that's in the
      path).

        If given a choice between putting the software package
        <strong><em>bigprog</em></strong> in the
        <strong>/usr/local/<em>bigprog</em></strong> section and the
        <strong>/opt/<em>bigprog</em></strong> section, it's hard to choose.
        Read any relevant exam question closely--the main difference being that
        the <strong>/opt</strong> section is not considered to be sharable,
        whereas the <strong>/usr</strong> section is often shared and mounted by
        client systems.

    <h1>File Management Commands</h1>
    <p>
      A major section of the 101 exam is dedicated to how to run commands
      properly with the right options and arguments. As a good sysadmin, you'll
      be expected to know how to create, delete, edit, set permissions on,
      display, move, copy, and determine the type of files and programs.
    </p>

        You must be able to pick proper and working commands out of lists of
        possibilities, type in appropriate strings in fill-in-the-blank boxes,
        and in general show that you've run the programs and utilities in
        question.

    <h2>Tips for working with Linux files</h2>
    <p>
      Because most users and sysadmins come from a Windows or other OS
      background, a quick set of recommendations for the less-experienced can be
      of help here:
    </p>
    <ul class="tips">
      <li>
        <strong>Hidden files aren't really hidden</strong>– They just begin with
        a ., such as the <code>.bashrc</code> and
        <code>.bash_profile</code> files. These are not viewable by normal users
        with conventional commands and switches and aren't deleted by commands
        such as <code>rm -f *.*.</code>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong
          >Filenames can contain multiple periods or no period
          characters</strong
        >– The filenames <code>this.is.a.long.file</code> and
        <code>thisisalongfile</code> are perfectly reasonable and possible.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Spaces in filenames look nice, but are a pain to type</strong>–
        Use an _ or a - instead of spaces because it's neater and easier than
        prefixing all spaces with a <code>\</code>. (To display a space in a
        filename, the system shows a space prefixes with a backslash.)
      </li>
    </ul>
