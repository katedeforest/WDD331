          Gilan threw back his head and laughed. 'A mistake? One mistake? You
          should be so lucky. You'll make dozens! I made four or five on my
          first day alone! Of course you'll make mistakes. Just don't make any
          of them twice. If you do mess things up, don't try to hide it. Don't
          try to rationalize it. Recognize it and admit it and learn from it. We
          never stop learning, none of us.

          The same God that placed that star in a precise orbit millennia before
          it appeared over Bethlehem in celebration of the birth of the Babe has
          given at least equal attention to placement of each of us in precise
          human orbits so that we may, if we will, illuminate the landscape of
          our individual lives, so that our light may not only lead others but
          warm them as well.
