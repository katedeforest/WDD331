          Gilan threw back his head and laughed. 'A mistake? One mistake? You
          should be so lucky. You'll make dozens! I made four or five on my
          first day alone! Of course you'll make mistakes. Just don't make any
          of them twice. If you do mess things up, don't try to hide it. Don't
          try to rationalize it. Recognize it and admit it and learn from it. We
          never stop learning, none of us.

          Halt regarded him. He loved Horace like a younger brother. Even like a
          second son, after Will. He admired his skill with a sword and his
          courage in battle. But sometimes, just sometimes, he felt an
          overwhelming desire to ram the young warrior's head against a
          convenient tree.
          <br />"You have no sense of drama or symbolism, do you?" he asked.
          <br />"Huh?" replied Horace, not quite understanding. Halt looked
          around for a convenient tree. Luckily for Horace, there were none in
          sight.
